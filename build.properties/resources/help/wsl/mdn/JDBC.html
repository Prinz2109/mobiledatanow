The JDBC drivers screen is a
<a href="../fw/MaintenancePanel.html#List">List Maintenance</a> screen
that you use to maintain the set of JDBC drivers recognised by Mobile Data  Now.
<p>
Before you use this screen to add a new JDBC driver for use by MDN you must
install the <i>JAR</i> file for the driver into the <i>lib</i> directory under
the MDN install directory. Then you must edit the <b>mdnserver.lax</b> file to
add the location of the JDBC driver to the <b>lax.class.path</b>. The
<i>lax.class.path</i> sets the CLASSPATH used by MDN Server to locate its JARS.
<p>
For example if your new JDBC driver is called <i>driver.jar</i> and you
installed MDN to <i>c:\mdn</i> then <i>driver.jar</i> should be placed in <i>c:\mdn\lib</i>
and the text <b>;c:\mdn\lib\driver.jar</b> should be appended to the end of the
line in <i>mdnserver.lax</i> that begins with <i>lax.class.path=</i>.
<p>
See the <a href="install/install.html">Installation and Configuration</a>
guide for more information on starting MDN, the MDN startup scripts and setting
classpaths.

<p>
Press the <b>Clear</b> button, then enter the driver information and press
<b>Insert</b>.
<p>
The <b>Name</b> field is the name you want to use to refer to the JDBC driver.
<p>
The <b>Driver</b> field is the fully qualified package and class name of the
JDBC driver. The driver documentation will indicate what name you should place
in this field.
<p>
<b>Description</b> is any addition text describing the driver.
