This document describes at a high level how to configure Mobile Data Now to
deliver data to mobile devices.
<br>
This document acts primarily as an index to other help documents that describe
in detail each of the screens and processes used to administer Mobile Data Now.
<p>
Before you can use Mobile Data Now you must first install and licence MDN as
described in the <a href="install/install.html">Installation and Configuration</a>
guide and start the MDN Server.
<p>
Also see <a href="index.html">MDN Administrator</a> and
<a href="Definitions.html">Definitions and Terminology</a> for more information
on using the MDN Administrator and the terms and terminology used in this
documentation.

<p><br>
<font size="+3">Using MDN Overview</font>

<p>
To deliver data to mobile users you must perform the following sequence of steps
using the MDN Administrator:
<p>
1. <a href="#Start">Start the Administrator and Login</a>.<br>
2. <a href="#DataStore">Import Data Store Definitions</a>.<br>
3. <a href="#ViewQuery">Build Data Views and Queries</a>.<br>
4. <a href="#UserGroup">Create Groups, Users and Permissions</a>.<br>
5. <a href="#Presentation">Build Presentation Menus</a>.<br>

<p><br>
<a href="#MirrorAndTransfer"><font size="+3">Mirroring and Data Transfers</font></a>
<p>
To make use of the optional Mirror Data Store and Data Transfer features you
must:
<p>
1. <a href="#Mirror">Create Mirror Data Stores</a>.<br>
2. <a href="#Mirrored">Mirror External Data Stores</a>.<br>
3. <a href="#DataTransfer">Create Data Transfers</a>.<br>

<p><br>
<a name="Start"><font size="+3">Start the Administrator and Login</font></a>
<p>
To start the <a href="index.html#Start">MDN Administrator</a> choose
<b>Mdn Administrator</b> from the <em>Start|Programs|Mobile Data Now</em> menu
under Windows, or type <em>mdnadmin</em> from a command shell window under
Linux/Solaris.

<br>
The MDN Administrator will display an error message and exit if the MDN
Server is not running or if MDN has not been licensed.
<br>
Enter a username and password and log in.



<p><br>
<a name="DataStore"><font size="+3">Import Data Store definitions</font></a>
<p>
Use the <a href="DataStores.html#Wizard">Data Store Wizard</a> to create a new
Data Store to access your database and import the table definitions of the
tables you wish to present with MDN.

<p><br>
<a name="ViewQuery"><font size="+3">Build Data Views and Queries</font></a>
<p>
Use the <a href="ViewQuery.html#ViewWizardSplash">View Wizard</a> to create one
or more views of your Data Stores.
<p>
Use the <a href="ViewQuery.html#QueryWizardSplash">Query Wizard</a> to create
one or more queries to select data from a view for presentation to your users.

<p><br>
<a name="UserGroup"><font size="+3">Create Groups, Users and Permissions</font></a>
<p>
Use the <a href="../fw/UserGroupMaintenance.html#GroupMaint">Groups</a> screen
to create the groups to which your users will belong. Each different group
can be configured with a different set of menus using the
<a href="PresentationBuilder.html">Presentation Builder</a>.
<p>
Use the <a href="../fw/UserGroupMaintenance.html#UserMaint">Users</a> screen to
create a user account for each user and to assign the users to groups.


<p><br>
<a name="Presentation"><font size="+3">Build Presentation Menus</font></a>
<p>
Use the <a href="PresentationBuilder.html">Presentation Builder</a> to build
a menu structure for each group.

<p><br><p>
<a name="MirrorAndTransfer"><font size="+3">Mirroring and Data Transfers</font></a>
<p>
Mirroring is optional feature of MDN that allows you to create a
<a href="#Mirror">mirror</a> copy of your <a href="#Mirrored">source data store</a>.
MDN will then access the mirror instead of the source data store. This can be
useful to reduce load or protect the source data store.
<br>
You can use automatically <a href="#Schedule">scheduled</a> or manual
<a href="#DataTransfer">data transfers</a> to populate the mirror with data from
the source data store.

<p><br>
<a name="Mirror"><font size="+3">Create Mirror Data Stores</font></a>
<p>
Use the <a href="Mirror.html#Mirror">Mirror Data Stores</a> screen to create
a Mirror Data Store.

<p><br>
<a name="Mirrored"><font size="+3">Mirror External Data Stores</font></a>
<p>
In the <a href="DataStores.html">Data Stores</a> screen select a Data Store,
press the <b>Properties</b> button to display the
<a href="Mirror.html">JDBC Data Store</a> properties screen. Check the
<b>Mirrored Data Store?</b> check box then select the desired Mirror Data
Store to activate mirroring for this Data Store.

<p><br>
<a name="DataTransfer"><font size="+3">Create Data Transfers</font></a>
<p>
Use the <a href="DataTransfers.html">Data Transfers</a> screen to create a
Data Transfer that will populate the Mirror Data Store with the desired data
from the source (mirror<b>ed</b>) Data Store. Press the <b>Execute</b> button to
execute the transfer and copy the data.

<p><br>
<a name="Schedule"><font size="+3">Schedule Data Transfers</font> (optional)</a>
<p>
If you want the Data Transfer to be run periodically use the
<a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a> screen to schedule a Data Transfer for
future execution.

<p>
Keep it small. Mobile devices and WAP phones usually have a very small screen.
When defining views use as few fields, especially naming fields, as possible and
keep the field display names short.

<p>
Delete extraneous fields from your data stores. When the data store wizard
imports a table it gets all fields. If you do not need to use a field in a view,
and it is not a key fields for the table then it is safe to delete it from the
data store. This will not affect the source table.

<p>
Assign keys for the tables in your data stores. Update and delete operations in
MDN may not work correctly if MDN cannot uniquely identify the correct record.

<p>
Show keys in the views or use auto key generation. When a new record is added in
MDN it must have valid keys which are unique. The user needs to be able to enter
values for the keys and any other fields that are required by your database,
otherwise the database will generate an error when inserting or updating the
record.
<br>
Alternatively the database could generate the keys using a trigger or
auto-number field. In this case the key field(s) need to be in the data store
so MDN can uniquely identify the record, but need not be shown in the view.

<p>
Use mirrors. If the data you are presenting with MDN is read-only, the source
database is heavily loaded or for security reasons you wish to reduce MDN's
access to the source database, then you can use mirror data stores and have
MDN work from  the mirror copy. It is usually best to use a separate mirror for
each data source because sharing a mirror between data sources may degrade
performance and will cause an error if the different data sources have tables
with the same name.

<p><br>
<a name="Testing"><font size="+3">Testing</font></a>
<p>
After you have defined you data stores, views and menus it is necessary to test
your MDN system. Most functions will work correctly, but it is possible that
database errors will occur if required fields or keys are omitted from the views
or if relationships have not been specified correctly.
<br>
Using the MDN Administrator select each query in each view and execute it by
pressing the <b>Execute</b> button.
<br>
Use a WAP browser or web browser to navigate through all the menu options in your MDN
system to ensure that they work correctly.

<p><br>
<a name="Troubleshooting"><font size="+3">Troubleshooting</font></a>
<p>
Errors when inserting or updating records may be due to a key or constraint
error in the underlying database. This can be caused by not correctly specifying
the keys for the data store entities, not including all required fields and keys
in the view or the user entering a key value which is already in use.
<br>
It is preferable in many cases for the database to generate the keys using
triggers or auto-number fields rather than requiring the user to enter the key
data.

<p>
An error when inserting records during a data transfer may be caused if two data
stores use the same mirror and they have a table name in common. Since a mirror
can not have two tables with the same name one definition will be overwritten,
leading to errors when transferring or viewing the data  in the data store.
<br>
To resolve this problem ensure that data stores that share a mirror do not have
any tables with the same name. It is preferable to use a separate mirror for
each mirrored data store.

<p>
Some databases treat tables, views and queries in a similar manner. Because of
this it may be possible to use the data store wizard import a &quot;table&quot;
that is in fact a <i>query</i>. Is may cause problems if the database does not
allow some operations, such as insert or update, to be performed on a query.
There will also be problems if the query requires run time parameters to
execute. In this case you will see an SQL exception with the message
<i>Too few Parameters</i>.
