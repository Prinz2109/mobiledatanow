<font size="+4">JDBC Data Store Properties</font>
<p>
The <i>JDBC Data Store</i> properties panel is used by the <i>Mirror Data Stores</i>
screen (as part of a <a href="../fw/MaintenancePanel.html#List">List Maintenance Panel</a>),
by the <i>Edit JDBC Data Stores</i> screen (as part of a <a href="../fw/MaintenancePanel.html#OKCancel">OK-Cancel Panel</a>)
and by the <i>Data Store <a href="../fw/WizardPanel.html">Wizard</a></i>.
<p>
For information on mirrors see the <a href="#Mirror">Mirror</a> section below.
<p>
The JDBC Data Store properties panel is used to define the JDBC connection
information used by MDN to connect to one of your company's databases.

<p><br>
Below is the JDBC Data Store properties panel as shown in an
<a href="../fw/MaintenancePanel.html#OKCancel">OK-Cancel Panel</a> by pressing
the <b>Properties</b> button with a Data Store selected in the
<a href="DataStores.html">Data Stores</a> screen. A similar panel is
displayed in the <i>Data Store Wizard</i> for entering the Data Store details.
<p>

<p>
The <b>Name</b> field is the name of the data store, it should describe the
content or purpose of the data store and <b>must</b> be unique within this
installation of MDN.
<p>
<b>Description</b> is any additional text to describe the data store.
<p>
The <b>Driver</b> combo box displays the set of JDBC drivers available to MDN,
as configured in the <a href="JDBC.html">JDBC Drivers</a> screen. Select the
appropriate driver for your database. You may need to install a driver for your
database if a suitable driver is not shown here.
<p>
The <b>URL</b> field specifies the JDBC URL to connect to your database. The
format of this URL is specific to the selected JDBC driver. See the
documentation for the JDBC driver to determine the correct format.
<br>
The format for the JDBC/ODBC Bridge driver is <b>jdbc:odbc:<i>dsn</i></b>, where
<i>dsn</i> is the ODBC data source name.
<p>
<b>Catalog</b> is the database catalog. Usually left blank.
<p>
<b>User</b> is the username used to log into the database.
<p>
<b>Password</b> is the password used to log into the database.
<p>
The <b>Mirrored Data Store?</b> checkbox is used to select this Data Store for
mirroring. This means that MDN will use a mirror copy of the source Data
Store rather than accessing it directly. You may use
<a href="DataTransfers.html">Data Transfers</a> to copy data from the source
Data Store to the mirror. If mirroring is selected then a combo box will be
displayed to allow the selection of the desired <a href="#Mirror">Mirror Data Store</a>.

<p><br>
<a name="Mirror"><font size="+3">Mirror Data Stores</font></a>

<p>
A <i>Mirror Data Store</i> is a location where mirrored data is stored separately
from the source data. This is distinct from a <i>Mirror<b>ed</b> Data Store</i>
which defines the source of the data, but has the <i>Mirrored Data Store?</i>
box checked to indicate that MDN will access the mirror copy rather than the
source.
<p>
To use mirroring you must first define one or more Mirror Data Stores, using the
<i>Mirror Data Stores</i> screen shown below, and then select a Data Store and
enable mirroring for it by checking the <i>Mirrored Data Store?</i> checkbox
for that Data Store using its properties screen.

<p>

<p>

This screen has the same fields as the <i>Edit JDBC Data Stores</i> screen with
the exception of the <i>Mirrored Data Store?</i> checkbox, as it is not valid
for a Mirror Data Store to be mirrored.
<p>
The Mirror Data Stores screen uses a
<a href="../fw/MaintenancePanel.html#List">List Maintenance Panel</a>
to show the list of mirrors, add mirrors, delete mirrors and edit the attributes
of a mirror.
