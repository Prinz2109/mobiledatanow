The <em>Search</em> screen allows you to select a specific record from a list of
available records. When it is first displayed the Search screen will often
display a full list of all the available records.
<p>
If no records are displayed or if the list is too long to easily find the
desired record you can enter the first part of the record name in the
<em>Name</em> field and press the <em>Search</em> button. The matching records
will be displayed in the <em>Results</em> panel. If the <em>Name</em> field is
empty all records will be selected.
<p>
Choose a record by clicking on it with the mouse and then pressing the
<em>Select</em> button. Press <em>Cancel</em> if you decide not to select a
record.
