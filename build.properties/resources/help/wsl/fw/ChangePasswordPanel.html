<p>
The <em>Change Password</em> screen is used to change the password for a user.
Enter the new password and then enter the same password again to confirm the
change and ensure you have not made a mistake typing in the password. For
security the password you enter is not displayed in a readable format.
<p>
When changing your own password you are required to enter your old (existing)
password to verify your identity before the password can be changed.
<p>
When an administrator is changing a password they do no need to enter the old
password. You should not tell anyone your password.
<p>
Once you have entered the correct passwords press <em>OK</em> to change the
password. An error message will be displayed if the the old password is
incorrect or the new password and confirmation password do not match.
<p>
Press <em>Cancel</em> if you decide not to change your password.
