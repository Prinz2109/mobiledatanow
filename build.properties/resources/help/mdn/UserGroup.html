<p>
A <i>User</i> represents a person who may log in to MDN either as an
administrator or as a WAP user. Users belong to <i>Group</i>s that define their
privileges and, in the case of WAP users, what menus, views and fields they can
access.
<p>

To create users, assign them to groups and set privileges for those groups see
the <a href="../fw/UserGroupMaintenance.html#UserMaint">Users</a> screen and the
<a href="../fw/UserGroupMaintenance.html#GroupMaint">Groups</a> screen.

<p>
You can switch between the
<a href="../fw/UserGroupMaintenance.html#UserMaint">Users</a>,
<a href="../fw/UserGroupMaintenance.html#GroupMaint">Groups</a> and
<a href="#DataViewPermissions">Data View Permissions</a> screens by clicking on
the desired tab.
<p>
<i>Note that group privileges are not currently required as the MDN Administrator
does not restrict function based on privileges.</i>
<p>
The <a href="PresentationBuilder.html">presentation</a> of menus to WAP users
is specified at the Group level, so when creating users and assigning them to
groups you will need to create separate groups for users that need different WAP
menus.

The Data View Permissions screen is used to limit which
<a href="ViewQuery.html">views</a> and view fields are accessible to a given
group. In general what a WAP user can see is determined by the structure of
their group's menus in the
<a href="PresentationBuilder.html">Presentation Builder</a> and by the fields
included in the definition of the <a href="ViewQuery.html">views</a>. For
security reasons it may be desirable for the members of a given group to see a
restricted set of fields.
<p>
To restrict the view or field permissions for a group expand that group and view
in the tree, select a view or field and press the <b>Enable</b> or <b>Disable</b>
button to grant or restrict view access to the field or view.
<p>
<i>Note that if a view field has been designated as a
<a href="ViewQuery.html#ViewFieldProperties">Naming Field</a> then that field
will still be shown as a part of the record name even if the field permission
has been removed. The disabled field will not be shown in view or edit screens.</i>
<p>
If a View is selected pressing the <b>Properties</b> button will display the
<a href="#GroupDataView">Group Data View</a> screen.

<p><br><a name="GroupDataView"><font size="+2">Group Data View</font></a>
<p>

<p><br>
The Group Data View screen allows you to control what changes members of a
group may make to the selected view.
The <b>Allow Add</b>, <b>Allow Edit</b> and <b>Allow Delete</b> check boxes
control whether the user may add, edit or delete records in the view.
