Some screens may add additional buttons whose function is specific to that type
of record.

screen which allows you to search for an select a record. When the record is
selected it will be displayed for editing in the Maintenance screen.

The <em>Insert/Update</em> update button will save any changes. If a new record
will be created the button will be displayed as <em>Insert</em>, if changes are
being made to an existing record the button will be displayed as
<em>Update</em>.

editing in response to pressing a <em>Properties</em> button or to enter the
initial data when creating a new record.
