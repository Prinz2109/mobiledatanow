<p>
The Mobile Data Now Administrator is a GUI application that is used to
manage Mobile Data Now (MDN).
<br>
The MDN Administrator is used to configure JDBC Drivers and Data Stores
to access your company's databases, define views and queries on that data and
build menus to present that data to your users. See the
<a href="HowTo.html">How To</a> guide for instructions about  how to perform
common tasks and <a href="Definitions.html">Definitions and Terminology</a> for
an explanation of the terms and terminology used in this documentation.
<p>
Also see the <a href="install/install.html">Installation and Configuration</a>
guide for details on installing MDN and configuring and starting the MDN Server
and Servlet.
<p>
Before using the Mobile Data Now Administrator you should read the
<a href="EULA.html">licence agreement</a>, register MDN and get a licence
activation key and start the MDN server and <a href="licence.html">set the licence
activation key</a>.

<p><br><a name="Start"><font size="+2">Starting the Mobile Data Now Administrator</font></a>
<p>
To start the MDN Administrator choose <b>Mdn Administrator</b> from the
<em>Start|Programs|Mobil Data Now</em> menu under Windows, or type
<em>mdnadmin</em> from a command shell window under Linux/Solaris.

<p>
The administrator will display an error message and fail to start if the MDN
Server is not running or if MDN has not been licensed.

<p><br><font size="+2">Login</font>
<p>
When the MDN Administrator application is started you must login
with a valid username and password using the
<a href="../fw/LoginPanel.html">Login</a> screen that is displayed when the MDN
Administrator starts. The username can be the name of any user defined in the
<a href="UserGroup.html">Users and Groups</a> screen. There is a default
administrator user with a username of <i>admin</i> and a password of <i>admin</i>
that you can use to log in for the first time. It is advisable to change the
default password immediately.
