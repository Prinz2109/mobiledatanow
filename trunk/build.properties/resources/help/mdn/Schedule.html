<p>
The schedule screens are used to schedule <a href"DataTransfers.html">Data Transfers</a>
for automatic execution. The MDN Server will periodically check for scheduled
data transfers and execute them at the defined times.
<p>
Three Schedule views and a properties screen are
provided:<br>
<a href="#Month">Month Calendar</a><br>
<a href="#Transfers">Scheduled Transfers</a><br>
<a href="#Day">Day View</a><br>
<a href="#SchedulingProperties">Scheduling Properties</a>
<p>
Click on the desired tab to switch between the  <i>Month Calendar</i> and
<i>Scheduled Transfers</i> views, both of which have a <b>Data Transfers</b>
combo box at the bottom of the screen that may be used to select which data
transfer(s) are shown. Select a Data Transfer in the combo to show all
schedulings for that data transfer, or select <b>&lt;&lt;All&gt;&gt;</b> to
show all schedulings for all Data Transfers.

<p>
The Month Calendar view shows a calendar of the current month. Click on the
<i>Month Calendar</i> tab to display the month calendar. All scheduled
data transfers matching the selection criteria in the <b>Data Transfers</b>
combo box are shown on the calendar.
<p>
If a scheduling has a <i>repeat</i> it may be shown in more than one
day on the calendar to represent all the days when the scheduled data transfer
will be executed.
<p>
You can select a day on the calendar by clicking on it. The selected day is
highlighted and that day's date is shown in the top right hand corner of the
calendar.
<p>
At the top left of the calendar are <b>month</b> and <b>year</b> fields that show
what month and year the calendar is displaying. Clicking on these fields will
allow you to change which month and year the calendar displays.
<p>
Pressing the <b>Schedule</b> button will create a new scheduling entry and
display  the <a href="#SchedulingProperties">Scheduling Properties</a> screen to
enter the scheduling details. The new scheduling will have its date set to the
day currently selected in the calendar.
<p>
Pressing the <b>View Day</b> button will display the <a href="#Day">Day View</a>
screen for the currently selected day.

<p>
The Scheduled Transfers view shows the details of the individual schedulings,
including which Data Transfer will be executed, when the execution will occur,
how often it will repeat and when the scheduling will end. Only schedulings that
match the criteria in the <b>Data Transfers</b> combo box will be displayed in
the list.
<p>
To delete a scheduling, including all repeats, select it in the list and press
the <b>Delete</b> button.
<p>
Selecting a scheduling and pressing the <b>Properties</b> button will display
the <a href="#SchedulingProperties">Scheduling Properties</a> to edit the
scheduling.

<p><br><font size="+2"><a name="Day">Day View</a></font>
<p>
<img src="images/ScheduleDay.gif">
<p>
The Day View screen shows all the schedulings, including repeats, for a single
day. It has a list of half hour time slots in which any schedulings will be
displayed. You can scroll up an down the time slots by clicking on the up and
down arrows. There are also up and down arrows to change the day month and year
shown by the Day View.
<p>
Selecting a time slot, by clicking on the time in the left column, and then
pressing the <b>Schedule</b> button will create a new scheduling entry and
display  the <a href="#SchedulingProperties">Scheduling Properties</a> screen to
enter the scheduling details. The new scheduling will have its date and time set
to the day and time currently selected in the day view.

<p><br><a name="SchedulingProperties"><font size="+2">Scheduling Properties</font></a>
<p>
<img src="images/ScheduleProp.gif">
<p>
The Scheduling Properties screen is used to enter or edit all the attributes of
a scheduling. A single scheduling may be shown in more than one day of the
<a href="#Month">Month Calendar</a> view or more than one time slot in the
<a href="#Day">Day View</a> if it has a repeat. Each scheduling is a single
entry in the <a href="Transfers">Scheduled Transfers</a> view.
<p>
Use the <b>Data Transfer</b> combo box to select which
<a href="DataTransfers.html">Data Transfer</a> this scheduling will execute.
<p>
<b>Start Date</b> is the date the data transfer will be executed, or first
executed if this scheduling is a repeat. Pressing the down arrow button to the
right of the start date field will display a small calendar to allow you to
select a date.
<p>
<b>Start Time</b> is the time the data transfer will be executed, using a 24
hour clock.
<p>
The fields in the <b>Repeat</b> grouping are used to specify repeats for this
scheduling. If a scheduling has a repeat it will be periodically executed until
its end date/time. Select one of the <b>None</b>, <b>Month</b>, <b>Week</b>,
<b>Day</b> or <b>Hour</b> radio buttons in conjunction with the <b>Every</b> field
to choose how often this scheduling will be repeated.
<p>
If the <b>End Date</b> field is left empty then the repeat will continue
indefinitely, otherwise it will stop as specified by the <b>End Date</b> and
<b>End Time</b> fields.
