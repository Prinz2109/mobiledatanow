<p>
The Data Transfers screen is used to configure a transfer of data from a
mirror<b>ed </b><a href="DataStores.html">Data Store</a> (one that has the
<i>Mirrored data Store?</i> box checked). The data is transferred to mirror
tables in a <a href="Mirror.html#Mirror">Mirror Data Store</a>.
<p>
Performing a data transfer updates the mirror with the current data from your
source database. This operation can be performed automatically by
<a href="Schedule.html">scheduling</a> a data transfer for automatic execution.
<p>
Note that the destination tables in the mirror database are emptied as the first
stage of the transfer, so after a transfer the mirror will contain exactly the
same data as the source data store.

<br>
The tree in the data transfers screen displays all the data transfers that have
been defined. Expanding a data transfer in the tree will show all the entities
(tables) that the transfer will cause to be transferred from the data store
to the mirror.

<p>
The <b>Transfer Wizard</b> button displays the
<a href="#Wizard">Transfer Wizard</a> which guides you through the steps
required to create a Data Transfer. The wizard may be used to create a new Data
Transfer or modify an existing one.

<p>
The <b>Schedule</b> button displays a
<a href="Schedule.html#SchedulingProperties">Schedule Properties</a> screen that
you can use to schedule the currently selected data transfer for automatic
execution.

<p>
If a Data Transfer is selected pressing the <b>Remove</b> button will completely
remove that data transfer. If an entity (table) within a data transfer is
selected then pressing the <b>Remove</b> button will remove just that entity
from its parent data transfer.

<p>
If a Data Transfer is selected pressing the <b>Properties</b> button will
display the <a href="#Wizard">Transfer Wizard</a> for that data transfer.

<p>
If a Data Transfer is selected pressing the <b>Execute</b> button will execute
the data transfer. The tables specified by the data transfer will be copied from
the data store (source database) to the mirror. A <i>Data Transfer Progress</i>
screen will be displayed showing how many records have been copied. The progress
screen will close automatically when the transfer is complete.

The Data Transfer <a href="../fw/Wizardpanel.html">Wizard</a> guides you through
the steps required to create a Data Transfer. The wizard may be used to create a
new Data Transfer or modify an existing one.

The Data Transfer wizard has the following wizard panels:<br>
<a href="#Splash">Select Create or Update</a><br>
<a href="#DataTansferProperties">Data Transfer Properties</a><br>
<a href="#DataTansferEntities">Data Transfer Entities</a>

<p><br><a name="Splash"><font size="+2">Select Create or Update</font></a>
<p>

<p>
The Select Create or Update wizard panel displays information on how to use the
Data Transfer Wizard and allows you to select whether to create a new Data
Transfer or modify the currently selected Data Transfer.

<p><br><a name="DataTansferProperties"><font size="+2">Data Transfer Properties</font></a>

<p>
The Data Transfer Properties wizard panel specifies the name of the transfer and
which Data Store is to be transferred.
<p>
<b>Name</b> is the name of the transfer, choose a name that describes what
is to be transferred.
<p>
<b>Description</b> is any additional text to describe the transfer.
<p>
The <b>Mirrored Data Store</b> combo box is used to select which Data Store will be
transferred. Select the desired Data Store in the combo box. Only
<a href="DataStores.html">Data Stores</a> that have the <i>Mirrored Data Store?</i>
box checked will be shown in the combo box as a Data Store must be mirrored to
be able to be transferred.

<p>
<img src="images/dtEntities.gif">

The Data Transfer Entities wizard panel allows you to select which entities in the
mirrored data store are to be transferred. Select one or more entities (tables)
in the <b>Available Entities</b> list or the <b>Selected Entities</b> list and
press the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;&lt;</b> button to add or remove the
entity from the list.
