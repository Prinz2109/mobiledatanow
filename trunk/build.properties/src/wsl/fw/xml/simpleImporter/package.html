<h1>SimpleImporter</H1>
<b>Simple</b> and <b>fast</b> importer for XML configuration or import files.
<br>
It is based on SAX and can be considered an extension to it. This means it is
callback oriented and does not build an internal data structure like the DOM.
While SAX is simple, fast, and memory friendly it might be a bit too 
rudimentary for most tasks. <code>SimpleImporter</code> adds more high level
means for importing XML while preserving the SAX's benefits. These are the 
main extensions to the SAX:<br>
<ol>
<li><em>Every callback includes a full path to the XML element</em>: In many 
cases this will make maintaining local stacks for keeping track of element
histories obsolete.
<li><em>Leading character data can be included into start element callback</em>: 
In many cases import files do not or only rarely contain mixed content. If so
it is convenient to have the the full content of an element at hand with a 
single callback.
<li><em>More than one listener can be registered</em>: Some XML files contain
different types of data that may be interesting to different listeners. E.g.
data to import from a server may contain error messages along with the real
content data. It may be convenient to
processes these blocks of data seperately.
</ol>
<br>
Even though the DOM in combination with XPath can not to be beaten in the 
area of convenience, I consider it a good compromise between convenience,
simplicity and speed. 
<br>
<br>
<code>SimpleImporter</code> is meant as a replacement for non-XML oriented 
tools like <code>digester</code> from the apache pepole and similar ones.
So, if you are satisfied with these tools, stick to them, forget about 
<code>SimpleImporter</code>. But if you are familiar with XML and prefer 
simple and explicite tools, try <code>SimpleImporter</code>.
